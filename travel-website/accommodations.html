    <h3>Boat ride to Palm Island</h3>
      <p>Do your dreams take you to a place where the sea dazzles in the late-afternoon sun, and the passing clouds imprint shadows on the sand as schools of fish commune in the sea?  A place so remote that you can only reach it by sea-plane or boat? That piece of paradise exists, lying discreetly off the fabled Meria coastline. Paradise Island awaits.</p>
    <h3>The Great Room</h3>
      <p>Our Great Room is the perfect place for reading or playing a good old fashioned board or card game. Help yourself to any books on the shelves. And our secret... it houses the only television on the island which is cleverly hidden behind the curtains. Relax and enjoy.</p>
